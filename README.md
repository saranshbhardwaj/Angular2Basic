# Angular2Basic
With the help of an online course, I have made this application based on Angular2. It includes basic features of Angular2 such as, two way binding, use of services and component, component and class decorators etc.

To run this application, NPM is needed to be installed in APM - Start folder. Then from command line execute 'npm start'
